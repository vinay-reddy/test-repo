this is a line that is added after a previous commint.
so, now the git satus should display it as modified in red.
if you git add this file, then it turns to modified  green.
and also, this file should appear only in vinay_local branch now.
if you check it in master branch. you will not see this.
so, how will u push this change to remote site ?
git fetch
